HOW IT IS AUTOMATED TO RUN EVERYDAY:

General Solution: CronJob: but no free service avaiable to handle cron job.

Current Solution: Using a service which checks server status by pinging to a specific endpoint: in our case it is https://uptimerobot.com/, if pings /run at a interval of 1hr daily, and the script to solve question runs.
